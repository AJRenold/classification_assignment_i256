For this assignment, I created the framework in driver.py for our group to create features and evaluate them. Since we are using the built in nltk classifiers, I decided to have the framework allow new features to be easily extended by creating functions that return dictionaries of features. These features are combined into a single dictionary and passed to the evaluate method. Besides the framework I individually worked on the adjective features. These features attempt to find common adjectives (unigrams) that are indicative of strongly opinionated sentences. This involved removing punctuation, tokenization, part of speech tagging, and manual inspection and tuning of parameters. I established that 4442/8209 (54%) sentences have sentiment 0 so this is a baseline for our classifier. After including my feature, I got about ~60% accuracy, a 10% improvement over baseline. My group's combined accuracy was about 65%
